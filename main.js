//Set myAge to my age!

let earlyYears = 2;


// Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the value saved to earlyYears by 10.5 and reassign it to earlyYears.
earlyYears *= 10.5;


// Take the myAge variable, and subtract 2 from it. Assign to laterYears
let laterYears = myAge - 2


// Multiply the laterYears variable by 4

// If you’d like to check your work at this point, console log earlyYears and laterYears. Are the values what you expected?
// console.log(earlyYears);
// console.log(laterYears);


// Add earlyYears and laterYears together
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);


// If you’d like extra practice, try writing this project without the *= operator.
